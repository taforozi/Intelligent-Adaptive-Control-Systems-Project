# Intelligent-Adaptive-Control-Systems-Project
The objective of this task was the applicability of the MRAC (Model Reference Adaptive Control) approach to a MIMO non-linear system so that the system state tracks asymptotically the state of the reference model and all the closed-loop signals remain uniformly bounded. The parameter convergence is neither guaranteed nor required. In this case the non-linear equation describes the roll-axis motion of an aircraft.
